### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mathew and I am studying Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering at UIUC. I love contributing to open source software and learning about high-performance computing. I also have an interest in learning about different machine learning techniques, such as SVMs and Neural Networks.

I'm currently maintaining an epidemic simulation repository called "Eir" which is written in Python.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
